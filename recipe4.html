			<h2>Banana Pudding</h2>
			by Trevor Hindman
			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>4 large eggs</li>
				<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
				<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>2 cups of whole milk</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
				<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
				<li>30-40 vanilla wafers</li>
				<li>3-4 medium ripe bananas</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Directions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Separate yolk from three of the eggs; set aside egg whites, and add remaining whole egg to the yolks</li>
				<li>In a saucepan, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in the whole egg and 3 yolks, and then stir in the milk.</li>
				<li>Cook uncovered, stirring often, until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.</li>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
				<li>Spread a thin layer of the pudding in a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Arrange a layer of vanilla wafers on top of the pudding. 
					Thinly slice the bananas crosswise, about 1/8 inch thick, and arrange a layer of banana slices over the wafers. Spread one-third
					 of the remaining pudding over the bananas and continue layering wafers, bananas and pudding, ending with pudding.</li>
				<li>To make the meringue, beat the reserved egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are stiff. Gradually beat in the 
					remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until the whites will not slide out of the mixing bowl when it is tilted.</li>
					<li>Spread the meringue over the pudding with a spatula, making a few decorative peaks on top, and bake until the meringue is
					lightly browned, 5 minutes.</li>
			</ul>
